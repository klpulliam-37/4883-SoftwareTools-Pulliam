# Report on A08

### When working on this project, I first began working on how I wanted the code to be structured. I felt that having each route simply return the result of a function being imported from another file would look the cleanest. Once I knew the structure, I began writing the psuedo code for each route to keep myself organized. Next, it was time to start on the implementation for each route. This is where most of my time was spent, and it is also where I faced the biggest challenge. At first, I was really struggling to get the routes to accept variables within the URL. I couldn't get the variables to work unless they were directly placed within the URL. I also prefer this way of handling variables anyways since I've worked with something similar before. At the start, I wrote all of the implementation in the same file. However, once I ensured that all of the code worked, I refactored the implementation code into a seperate file.
