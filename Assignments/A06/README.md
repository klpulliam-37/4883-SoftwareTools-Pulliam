# NCurses

## What is NCurses?
### NCurses is a clone of the original System V Release 4.0 (SVr4) curses. <br> The name Curses was used in place of "Cursor Optimization" and NCurses stands for "New Curses".

## What does NCurses do?
### NCurses is an open source library that can be used to create user interfaces that run under a terminal emulator.<br>
### A couple examples of NCurses's capabilites are moving the cursor to any point in the terminal, and changing the color of the text and background.

# My Experience with NCurses
## NCurses vs PDCurses
### PDCurses is the Windows port for NCurses. <br> NCurses is less difficult to use compared to PDCurses. PDCurses is not very user friendly.
## Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
### Due to NCurses being only available for Linux, I had to install WSL in order to use it since I don't own any hardware running a Linux system. <br>
### The distribution I used was Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS which was availble in the Microsoft Store.
